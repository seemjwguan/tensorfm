# Welcome!

This repository contains the implementations of tensor factorization machines (FMs) studied in our paper "*Tensor factorization machine and its lifted form*."

# How to use?

To reproduce our results, you can simply run *tensorFM_handler_ori.m* for tensor FM whereas *tensorFM_handler_lifted.m* for lifted tensor FM.

# Dependencies

The following packages are required for running the programs:

- MATLAB Tensor Toolbox (downloadable from [here](https://www.tensortoolbox.org/))
- MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox (not necessary, but if you want to use parallel computations for acceleration)
